### Some helpful scripts for various tasks :wink: ###

```` terabox_iterate_select.js ````
<br>This sctipt will only work in console of browser. Go to [terrabox](https://www.terabox.com) folder with files you want to download. View must be set to grid and all elements must be loaded to DOM (scroll to the bottom of the page).
<br>Paste contents of file to console, than invoke
```javascript
iterate(from, to)
```
Start from 0 to 50, because when i
selected 100 files at one go and hit "download" nothing happened.
